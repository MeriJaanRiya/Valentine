        <p>Dear Riya,</p>
        
        <p>For the past 9 months, you have completely turned my life upside down (kidding, in a good way only hehe), in ways I did not even know were possible. From being my best friend (who I apparently let boss me around) to somehow tricking me into dating you, you have filled my days with laughter, chaos, and happiness. I truly look forward to talking to you every single day, even though we talk for hours I can never get enough of you babygirl. Somehow, we’ve officially become the kings of completely derailing every conversation, tumbling into random topics for hours. So, before I start listing the more than a 100 things I love about you and accidentally turn this into a novel of a love letter…let me ask you something.
<br><br>
With our first (and many more in the future) Valentines day coming up, here is a very important question...💕  
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>💖 Yours truly, <br> From : Babygirl (yes fineeee, im babygirl)</p>
